<h3>WIKIPEDIA</h3>
<p>Wikipedia is a free, multilingual online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based editing system. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the internet, with more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages.
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, and is currently owned by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. The name "Wikipedia" is a combination of the words "wiki" (a technology for creating collaborative websites) and "encyclopedia."
Wikipedia's content is contributed by volunteers from all around the world, who write and edit articles on various topics. The site has a system of checks and balances in place to ensure the reliability and accuracy of its content, including a peer review process and a team of administrators who monitor and enforce the site's rules and guidelines.
As an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia provides an easily accessible and free source of information on a wide range of subjects. However, it is important to note that it should not be considered the sole source of information on any given topic, and its accuracy may vary depending on the article. <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li> </p>
 

<h3>PROJECT GUTENBERG</h3>
<p> Project Gutenberg (PG) is a volunteer-led initiative that aims to digitize and archive cultural works, focusing primarily on literature. The project collects public domain books and makes them available for free download, allowing people to access and enjoy these works regardless of their location or financial situation.
Project Gutenberg was founded in 1971 by American writer and computer programmer Michael S. Hart. It is one of the oldest digital libraries, and as of April 2021, it has over 60,000 items in its collection. These items include books, as well as other texts like speeches, essays, and poetry.
The books in the Project Gutenberg collection are typically available in several formats, including plain text, HTML, EPUB, and Kindle. Users can browse the library by author, title, language, or category, or they can search for specific books using keywords.
In addition to the main Project Gutenberg site, there are several affiliated sites that focus on different languages or genres, such as Project Gutenberg Australia, Project Gutenberg Canada, and Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing Press.
As a valuable resource for readers, researchers, and educators, Project Gutenberg continues to play an important role in preserving and promoting access to literature and other written works. <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a></li> </p>
